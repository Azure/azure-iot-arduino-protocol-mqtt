# AzureIoTProtocol_MQTT - Azure IoT MQTT protocol library for Arduino

This library is a port of the MQTT protocol from 
[Microsoft Azure IoT device SDK for C](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/master/c/readme.md)
to Arduino. Together with the AzureIoTHub, it allows you to use several Arduino compatible 
boards with Azure IoT MQTT protocol.

## Simple Sample Instructions

### ESP8266
##### Sparkfun Thing, Adafruit Feather Huzzah, or generic ESP8266 board

1. Install esp8266 board support into your Arduino IDE.
    * Start Arduino and open Preferences window.
    * Enter `http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json` into Additional Board Manager URLs field. You can add multiple URLs, separating them with commas.
    * Open Boards Manager from Tools > Board menu and install esp8266 platform 2.2.0 or later
    * Select your ESP8266 board from Tools > Board menu after installation

2. Open the `simplesample_mqtt` example from the Arduino IDE  File->AzureIoTHub->ESP8266->Examples menu.
4. Update Wifi SSID/Password and IoT Hub Connection string in iot_configs.h
    * Ensure you are using a wifi network that does not require additional manual steps after connection, such as opening a web browser.
6. Access the [SparkFun Get Started](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/samples/iot-hub-c-thingdev-getstartedkit/) tutorial to learn more about Microsoft Sparkfun Dev Kit.
7. Access the [Huzzah Get Started](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/samples/iot-hub-c-huzzah-getstartedkit/) tutorial to learn more about Microsoft Huzzah Dev Kit.
